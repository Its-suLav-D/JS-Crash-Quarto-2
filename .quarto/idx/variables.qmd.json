Constants have the same behavior\n  as variables declared with <span>let</span>, except they cannot be reassigned.\n</p>\n\n> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/Const \n\n## Block Scope\n\n<p>\n  The behavior of a variable that is only accessible inside of the block it was defined. Most of the\n  time, the block will simply be the nearest pair of curly braces to the declaration.\n</p>\n\n## Function Scope \n<p>\n  The behavior of a variable that is accessible anywhere inside of the function it was defined.\n</p>\n\n## Hoisting \n  <p>\n    The process by which the JavaScript engine moves variable declarations to\n    the top of their scope, allocating memory for them before reaching the line\n    of code where they are declared. For variables declared with\n    <span>var</span>, they are initialized to <span>undefined</span> until\n    reaching the line of code that initializes the variable. For variables\n    declared with <span>let</span> or <span>const</span>, the variable is not\n    initialized and thus cannot be accessed before the line of code that\n    initializes it. For example:\n  </p>\n\n```{.js}\nconsole.log(testVar) // Undefined\nconsole.log(testLet) // reference error \n\nvar testVar = 10;\nlet testLet = 10; \n\nconsole.log(testVar) // 10 \nconsole.log(testlet) // 10 \n\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":{"source":false,"toggle":true,"caption":"See code"},"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":false,"html-math-method":"katex","reference-location":"margin","output-file":"variables.html"},"language":{"code-summary":"Show the code"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"toc-location":"right","code-copy":"hover","smooth-scroll":true,"anchor-sections":true,"fig-cap-location":"margin","footnotes-hover":true,"citations-hover":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
