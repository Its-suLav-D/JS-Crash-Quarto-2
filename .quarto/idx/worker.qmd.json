{"title":"Web-Worker","markdown":{"headingText":"Web-Worker","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\na web worker is a background thread that runs concurrently with the main thread of your web application, allowing you to perform long-running tasks or computations without blocking the UI or other parts of the application. Web workers are particularly useful for tasks that are computationally intensive or that involve network communication, as they can help to improve the performance and responsiveness of your application.\n\nWeb workers are created using the Worker constructor, which takes the URL of a JavaScript file as an argument. The worker file must contain the code that the worker will execute.\n\nHere is an example of creating and using a web worker:\n```{.js}\nconst worker = new Worker('worker.js');\n\nworker.onmessage = function(event) {\n  console.log(`Received message from worker: ${event.data}`);\n}\n\nworker.postMessage('Hello, worker!');\n```\nIn this example, the worker.js file contains the code that the worker will execute. The main thread creates a new worker using the Worker constructor and specifies the URL of the worker file. It then registers an event handler for the message event, which is fired when the worker sends a message back to the main thread.\n\nThe main thread can communicate with the worker using the postMessage() method, which sends a message to the worker. The worker can respond by sending a message back to the main thread using the postMessage() method on the self object.\n\nHere is an example of the code in the worker file:\n```{.js}\nself.onmessage = function(event) {\n  console.log(`Received message from main thread: ${event.data\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":{"source":false,"toggle":true,"caption":"See code"},"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":false,"html-math-method":"katex","reference-location":"margin","output-file":"worker.html"},"language":{"code-summary":"Show the code"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":{"light":"cosmo","dark":"darkly"},"toc-location":"right","code-copy":"hover","smooth-scroll":true,"anchor-sections":true,"fig-cap-location":"margin","footnotes-hover":true,"citations-hover":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
